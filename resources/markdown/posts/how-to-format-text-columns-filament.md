## Introduction

Have you ever looked at your Filament admin panel and thought, "These text columns could use a bit of sprucing up"? Well, you're in luck! Today, that's what I want to write about. Properly formatted text columns can dramatically improve readability and make your admin panel look more professional.

## Setting Up Your First Formatted Text Column

Let's start with the basics. Creating a text column in Filament is pretty straightforward:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
```

This will display the "title" field as is. But we want to add some swag, right? That's where the `formatStateUsing()` method comes in handy:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state) => Str::title($state))
```

Now we're talking! This will display the title in title case. But hold on, there's something important we need to discuss...

## The $state Variable: A Crucial Detail for Formatting

Here's a little gotcha that might trip you up: when using `formatStateUsing()`, always use `$state` as your variable name. It might be tempting to use something like `$title`, but resist that urge! If you use any other name, Filament will throw a fit (technically, a `Illuminate\Contracts\Container\BindingResolutionException`). 

For example, this will cause an error:

```php
// Don't do this!
->formatStateUsing(fn (string $title) => strtoupper($title))
```

Always stick with `$state`.

## Practical Examples: Formatting Text Columns in Filament

Now that we've got the basics down, let's look at some practical ways to format your text columns:

1. Capitalizing the first letter:
   ```php
   ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state) => ucfirst($state))
   ```

2. Truncating long strings:
   ```php
   ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state) => Str::limit($state, 50))
   ```

3. Adding a prefix:
   ```php
   ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state) => "Article: {$state}")
   ```

4. Formatting dates:
   ```php
   ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state) => Carbon::parse($state)->format('M d, Y'))
   ```

## Best Practices for Formatting Text Columns in Filament

While formatting in Filament is powerful, remember that it's applied on the fly. For data that's always displayed in a certain format, consider storing it that way in the database instead. It can be more efficient, especially for large datasets.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You're now equipped to turn those plain text columns into formatted masterpieces. Remember, the key is to use `$state`, get creative with your formatting, and always consider the end-user experience.
