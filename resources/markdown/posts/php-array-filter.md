**Use [`array_filter()`](https://www.php.net/array_filter) when you want to keep only the array values that match a condition.**

PHP passes each value to your callback and keeps the ones for which the callback returns `true`. The two gotchas worth remembering are that omitting the callback removes values like `'0'` and `0`, and the function preserves the original keys unless you reindex the result.

| Gotcha | What PHP does | Fix when needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No callback | Removes every falsy value, including `0`, `'0'`, `false`, `null`, `''`, and `[]` | Write an explicit callback |
| Numeric keys | Preserves the original indexes and can leave gaps | Wrap the result in `array_values()` |
| JSON output | Encodes a numeric array with gaps as a JSON object | Reindex before `json_encode()` when the API expects a list |

## How to use array_filter() in PHP

```php
array_filter(array $array, ?callable $callback = null, int $mode = 0): array
```

By default, the callback receives the value only.

## Filter values with a callback

Here is the most common example:

```php
$array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

$even = array_filter($array, fn (int $value) => $value % 2 === 0);

print_r($even);
```

This keeps only the even numbers from the original array.

## Remove empty values without a callback

If you call `array_filter()` without a callback, PHP removes values that `empty()` considers empty.

```php
$values = ['foo', false, -1, null, '', '0', 0];

$filtered = array_filter($values);

print_r($filtered);
// ['foo', -1]
```

That behavior is useful, but it can surprise you because `'0'` and `0` are removed too.

If you want to remove only `null` and empty strings while keeping `0`, `'0'`, or `false`, be explicit:

```php
$values = ['foo', false, -1, null, '', '0', 0];

$filtered = array_filter(
    $values,
    fn ($value) => $value !== null && $value !== '',
);

print_r($filtered);
// ['foo', false, -1, '0', 0]
```

That small callback is usually safer than relying on the default behavior when form or request data is involved.

## Filter by key or by both key and value

Use the third argument when the key matters:

```php
$settings = [
    'app_name' => 'Blog',
    'app_env' => 'production',
    'db_host' => '127.0.0.1',
];

$appOnly = array_filter(
    $settings,
    fn (string $key) => str_starts_with($key, 'app_'),
    ARRAY_FILTER_USE_KEY,
);
```

If you need both the value and the key, use `ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH`:

```php
$numbers = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3, 'd' => 4];

$filtered = array_filter(
    $numbers,
    fn (int $value, string $key) => $key === 'b' || $value === 4,
    ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH,
);
```

That is the mode to reach for when the filtering rule depends on field names as much as data.

## Keys are preserved

`array_filter()` keeps the original array keys. That is often what you want, but it can leave gaps in numeric indexes:

```php
$array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

$even = array_filter($array, fn (int $value) => $value % 2 === 0);

print_r($even);
// [1 => 2, 3 => 4]
```

If you want a clean zero-based array again, wrap the result in `array_values()`:

```php
$even = array_values($even);
// [2, 4]
```

This changes JSON output too. A PHP array with numeric key gaps becomes a JSON object:

```php
$even = array_filter([1, 2, 3, 4], fn (int $value) => $value % 2 === 0);

echo json_encode($even);
// {"1":2,"3":4}

echo json_encode(array_values($even));
// [2,4]
```

That difference matters in API responses because JavaScript treats those two shapes differently.

## Common pitfalls

Your callback must return something truthy or falsy. Forgetting `return` is a classic mistake:

```php
$array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

$even = array_filter($array, function (int $value) {
    $value % 2 === 0;
});

print_r($even);
// []
```

Also, avoid modifying the array from inside the callback. The PHP manual treats that behavior as undefined.

`array_filter()` is the right tool when you want to keep matching values, keys, or key-value pairs. Be explicit about falsy values, and reindex only when the consumer needs a list.

If you spend a lot of time shaping arrays before they hit the rest of the app, these are the next reads I would keep nearby:

- [Reset array keys cleanly when the indexes get weird](/php-array-values)
- [Choose the right PHP array sorting function](/php-array-sort)
- [Map arrays in PHP without overcomplicating the callback](/php-array-map)
- [Count arrays correctly before you branch on them](/php-array-length)
