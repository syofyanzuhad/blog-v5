## Introduction

PHP 8.5 shipped on November 20, 2025. The release brings a real pipe operator, a built-in URI extension, `clone()` with property overrides, `#[\NoDiscard]`, and a lot of smaller ergonomics wins.

This guide focuses on the changes that matter in day-to-day code, plus a few upgrade notes worth checking before you roll 8.5 out.

## PHP 8.5 release date and schedule

The official [preparation tasks list](https://wiki.php.net/todo/php85) shows the final calendar. The release cycle had four alpha slots, but `Alpha 3` was skipped and `RC5` was added late, followed by the November 20, 2025 GA release.

## How to install PHP 8.5 (Homebrew and Docker)

If you’re on macOS and want to test PHP 8.5, Homebrew makes it easy. Bottles are available. The safest way to avoid conflicts with Homebrew core is to use the dedicated tap and fully qualified formula. The tap’s status is documented in the [tap README](https://github.com/shivammathur/homebrew-php).

1. Install the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh) if it’s not done already.
2. Run `brew update` to make sure Homebrew and the formulae are up to date.
3. Add the PHP tap: `brew tap shivammathur/php`.
4. Install PHP 8.5 from the tap: `brew install shivammathur/php/php@8.5`.
5. Link it so the `php` shim targets 8.5: `brew link --overwrite --force shivammathur/php/php@8.5` (this overwrites the `php` shim).

Tip if you have multiple PHP versions installed: run `brew unlink php` (or another version like `php@8.3`) before linking 8.5; later run `brew link` for the one you want active.

If you prefer not to touch your Homebrew PHP, you can test using the official [PHP Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php). 8.5 tags are available there too.

## New in PHP 8.5

### Pipe operator (|>)

The PHP 8.5 pipe operator (|>) is my favorite of the PHP 8.5 features. It passes the result of the left expression as the single argument to the callable on the right, letting you write readable, left-to-right pipelines.

A type-safe example that stays string-only until the end:

```php
$length = "  Hello, World!  "
    |> trim(...)
    |> strtoupper(...)
    |> htmlentities(...)
    |> strlen(...);
```

Rules to remember for the PHP 8.5 pipe operator:
- Right-hand side must be a callable that accepts exactly one parameter; the piped value becomes that parameter.
- You can pipe into closures, arrow functions, first-class callables, array callables, and invokable objects.
- Built-ins that accept no parameters cannot be used directly: wrap them in a callable that accepts one parameter, for example `$x |> (fn($_): string => phpversion());`.
- The operator is left-associative and binds after arithmetic but before comparisons and before the null-coalescing operator (??); use parentheses for mixed expressions.
- Gotchas: wrap arrow-function steps in parentheses when used in a chain; by-reference callables are not allowed on the right-hand side.

A quick example showing an arrow function in a chain:

```php
$result = "  a  "
    |> trim(...)
    |> (fn ($s) => $s . "!")
    |> strlen(...);
```

Learn more: [What’s new in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.new-features.php) and the [pipe operator RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator-v3).

### URI extension (RFC 3986 and WHATWG URL)

PHP 8.5 includes a new, always-available URI extension with standards-compliant parsers for both RFC 3986 and the WHATWG URL standard. It provides immutable value objects with withers, normalization, and it throws on invalid input. Classes include `Uri\Rfc3986\Uri` and `Uri\WhatWg\Url`. Under the hood it uses the uriparser and Lexbor libraries.

```php
use Uri\Rfc3986\Uri;

$u = new Uri('https://example.com/a/../b?x=1#frag');
$u = $u->withPath('/b');

echo (string) $u; // https://example.com/b?x=1#frag
```

Overview and background: [the PHP 8.5 release page](https://www.php.net/releases/8.5/en.php) and the [URI extension RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/uri).

### array_first and array_last

Two small helpers you’ll actually use: array_first and array_last return the first and last element of an array. On empty arrays they return null, which composes well with `??` to provide defaults.

```php
$numbers = [10, 20, 30];

unset($numbers[0]);

array_first($numbers); // 20
array_last($numbers);  // 30

$empty = [];
array_first($empty) ?? 'n/a'; // 'n/a'
```

`$numbers[0]` doesn’t exist anymore and you can’t know that in advance. And obviously, you usually never know which key is the last one of an array, so array_last()’s usefulness is immediately obvious.

Learn more: [RFC: array_first and array_last](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/array_first_last).

### Fatal error backtraces (fatal_error_backtraces)

Debugging gets easier with fatal error backtraces. The new `fatal_error_backtraces` INI adds a stack trace to fatal errors and respects `#[\SensitiveParameter]` and `zend.exception_ignore_args`.

```ini
; php.ini
fatal_error_backtraces = 1
```

Details: [What’s new in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.new-features.php) and the [RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/error_backtraces_v2).

### Clone with v2

PHP 8.5 turns `clone` into `clone()`, so you can pass a second array argument to adjust properties on the cloned object. It calls `__clone()` before assignments and respects visibility and property hooks, which is great for immutable patterns.

```php
readonly class User
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $name,
        public bool $isAdmin = false,
    ) {}

    public function asAdmin(): self
    {
        return clone($this, ['isAdmin' => true]);
    }
}
```

Learn more: [the PHP 8.5 release page](https://www.php.net/releases/8.5/en.php) and the [clone with v2 RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/clone_with_v2).

### Handler introspection (get_error_handler/get_exception_handler)

New functions `get_error_handler()` and `get_exception_handler()` let you introspect the current handlers at runtime.

```php
set_error_handler(fn () => true);
var_dump(get_error_handler());
restore_error_handler();

set_exception_handler(fn (Throwable $e) => null);
var_dump(get_exception_handler());
restore_exception_handler();
```

Learn more: [new functions in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.new-functions.php) and the [RFC for handler introspection](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/get-error-exception-handler).

### Intl updates (list formatter, RTL check, NumberFormatter updates)

Internationalization gets a nice bump in PHP 8.5: `IntlListFormatter` formats human-readable lists; `locale_is_right_to_left()` and `Locale::isRightToLeft()` help with right-to-left scripts; `Locale::addLikelySubtags()` and `Locale::minimizeSubtags()` help normalize locale tags; and PHP 8.5 also adds new Intl formatting constants, including compact-decimal support.

```php
$lf = new IntlListFormatter('en', IntlListFormatter::TYPE_AND);
echo $lf->format(['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges']); // apples, bananas, and oranges

$isRtl = locale_is_right_to_left('ar'); // true
```

### grapheme_levenshtein

`grapheme_levenshtein` computes a Unicode-aware [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) that understands grapheme clusters (what users perceive as characters), which is perfect for strings like “café”.

```php
grapheme_levenshtein('café', 'cafe'); // 1
```

Learn more: [new functions in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.new-functions.php).

### Attributes on constants

PHP 8.5 lets you add attributes directly to const declarations. The main constraint: one constant per statement.

```php
#[\MyAttribute]
const EXAMPLE = 1;

#[\MyAttribute]
const A = 1; // OK
// const A = 1, B = 2; // Not allowed with attributes
```

You can reflect these with `ReflectionClassConstant::getAttributes()` or `ReflectionConstant::getAttributes()`. The built-in #[\Deprecated] works on constants too, so you can mark constants as deprecated and surface warnings.

Learn more: [RFC: attributes on constants](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes-on-constants).

### Final property promotion

Final property promotion rounds out the work started in 8.4 with final properties and property hooks. In PHP 8.5 you can mark a promoted property as `final` directly in the constructor, preventing redeclaration or overrides in child classes. Visibility is optional when using `final` (defaults to `public`), and you can combine this with property hooks.

Before PHP 8.5, you had to declare the final property in the class body, then assign it in the constructor:

```php
class User {
    final public readonly string $name;

    public function __construct(string $name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }
}
```

With PHP 8.5, you can promote and finalize the property in one place:

```php
class User {
    public function __construct(
        final public readonly string $name
    ) {}
}
```

Learn more: [RFC: final property promotion](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/final_promotion).

### Closures and first-class callables in constant expressions

PHP 8.5 allows static closures in constant expressions and also allows first-class callables, which complements the closures-in-constants feature. Both are supported now, with a few restrictions.

```php
class Foo {
    // Static closure as a constant
    public const UPPER = static function (string $v): string { return strtoupper($v); };

    // First-class callable as a constant
    public const LOWER = 'strtolower'(...);
}
```

Notes:
- Closures must be `static`. No variable capture (`use ($x)`) or arrow functions (they auto-capture) are allowed in constant expressions.
- First-class callables like `'strtolower'(...)` or `Bar::baz(...)` are allowed. (Closures are covered by the separate “closures in constant expressions” RFC.)

Learn more: [What’s new in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.new-features.php) and the [closures in constant expressions RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures_in_const_expr).

### cURL: curl_multi_get_handles

`curl_multi_get_handles` lets you retrieve all easy handles attached to a multi handle, which is useful for debugging and housekeeping.

```php
$mh = curl_multi_init();
$ch = curl_init('https://example.com');
curl_multi_add_handle($mh, $ch);
$handles = curl_multi_get_handles($mh); // array of CurlHandle
```

Learn more: [new functions in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.new-functions.php).

### See only the settings you changed with php --ini=diff

A small but powerful CLI addition: `php --ini=diff` prints only INI settings that differ from PHP’s built-in defaults, which is great for quick diagnostics.

```bash
php --ini=diff
```

Example output:

```text
Non-default INI settings:
html_errors: "1" -> "0"
implicit_flush: "0" -> "1"
max_execution_time: "30" -> "0"
```

Ops note: a new `max_memory_limit` INI (INI_SYSTEM, default `-1`) can cap `memory_limit` at the system level. See [other changes in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.other-changes.php).

### The new PHP_BUILD_DATE constant

There’s a new `PHP_BUILD_DATE` constant that exposes the timestamp of the binary you’re running, which helps when comparing nightlies or deployment artifacts.

```php
echo PHP_BUILD_DATE; // e.g., Sep 16 2025 10:44:26
```

Note: it prints a C-style timestamp string, not ISO-8601.

Learn more: [new global constants in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.constants.php).

### Marking return values as important (#[\NoDiscard])

#[\NoDiscard] marks functions or methods whose return values must not be ignored, helping developers spot silent bugs.

```php
#[\NoDiscard("processing might fail for individual items")]
function bulk_process(array $items): array { /* ... */ }

bulk_process($items);            // Warning.
$results = bulk_process($items); // OK.
(void) bulk_process($items);     // Explicitly ignore (suppresses the warning).
```

Engine details: ignoring a #[\NoDiscard] return value emits E_WARNING for internal functions and E_USER_WARNING for userland; functions that return `void`/`never`, and magic methods that must be `void`, cannot use it. Tip: the `(void)` cast is an explicit discard.

Learn more: [Marking return value as important (RFC)](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/marking_return_value_as_important).

## Under the hood

- OPcache is no longer optional: it is always compiled in from PHP 8.5 onward, while enablement remains controlled by INI settings such as `opcache.enable` and `opcache.enable_cli`. This affects packaging and “what is included by default” in many environments. See the [OPcache required RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/make_opcache_required).
- A new `max_memory_limit` INI caps `memory_limit` at the system level (INI_SYSTEM, default `-1`), which helps lock down production defaults. See [other changes in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.other-changes.php).

## Other PHP 8.5 changes worth knowing

- DOM picked up practical additions like `outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML()`, `getElementsByClassName()`, and `$children`, which makes the modern DOM API much nicer to use.
- Cookies and filters got a few practical upgrades too: CHIPS/partitioned cookies via the `"partitioned"` flag in `setcookie()` and session options, plus `FILTER_THROW_ON_FAILURE`.
- The language kept getting polished: `#[\Override]` now works on properties, `#[\Deprecated]` works on traits and constants, `#[\DelayedTargetValidation]` is available for tooling-heavy attributes, `Closure::getCurrent()` was added, and static properties can now use asymmetric visibility.

All of those shipped in the final 8.5 line. The official overview is in [What’s new in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.new-features.php).

## What to test before upgrading to PHP 8.5

Most apps will upgrade cleanly, but these are worth a quick grep before deployment:

- Remove any explicit OPcache shared-extension loading such as `zend_extension=opcache` or `php_opcache.dll`; OPcache is compiled in now.
- Replace shell backticks and non-standard cast names like `(integer)` or `(boolean)`, which are deprecated in 8.5.
- Stop relying on `null` as an array offset or as the key argument to `array_key_exists()`, which is now deprecated.
- If you still use `__sleep()` and `__wakeup()`, plan a move to `__serialize()` and `__unserialize()`.

See [backward incompatible changes in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.incompatible.php) and [deprecated features in PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration85.deprecated.php).
