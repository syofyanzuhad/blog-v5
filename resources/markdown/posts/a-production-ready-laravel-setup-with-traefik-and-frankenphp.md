Looking to take Laravel to production with Docker? This guide by Daniel Petrica shows a clean path using Traefik as the reverse proxy and FrankenPHP to run PHP fast and lean.

It walks through a simple, repeatable setup. You get HTTPS, routing, and zero downtime deploys. Caching and queues are covered too, so your app stays quick under load.

I liked how the services are split, and how health checks and logs fit in. It is easy to follow, even if you are new to Traefik or FrankenPHP.

Here is a tiny taste of the wiring with Traefik labels:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: dunglas/frankenphp
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app.rule=Host(`example.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
```

If you want a practical blueprint for Docker, Laravel, Traefik, and FrankenPHP, this piece is a great start. It helps you ship with confidence, without a ton of guesswork.

If you are moving from local confidence to something you can run in production without flinching, these next reads help with hosting and deployment decisions:

- [Compare hosting options before you deploy another Laravel app](/best-laravel-hosting-providers)
- [See whether Laravel Forge still fits the way you deploy](/laravel-forge)
- [Compare PHP hosting options before you pay for one](/best-cloud-hosting-provider-php)
