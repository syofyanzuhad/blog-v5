**If your real question is "should I switch to Bun?", the short answer is this: choose Bun when you want an all-in-one toolchain, not just a different package manager.**

If you only want the package-manager decision fast:

- choose **Bun** when you want installs, scripts, and the runtime to move together
- choose **pnpm** when you want the strongest package-manager upgrade with minimal runtime disruption
- choose **npm** when compatibility and lowest-friction defaults matter more than changing tools

That framing matters because Bun is not only a package manager. It is also a runtime, test runner, and bundler.

## The core decision: Bun vs pnpm vs npm

Here is the quickest way to compare them for real-world use.

| Tool | Best fit | Runtime included | Lockfile | Monorepo workflow | Script security default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bun | You want one tool for install + run + build + test | Yes | `bun.lock` | Good, with `--filter` and isolated installs | Untrusted dependency scripts are blocked; a default trusted list still exists |
| pnpm | You want the strongest package-manager upgrade while staying in standard Node.js land | No | `pnpm-lock.yaml` | Excellent | Traditional Node ecosystem behavior |
| npm | You want the safest compatibility baseline | No | `package-lock.json` | Fine, but less opinionated | Traditional Node ecosystem behavior |

If you read nothing else, that table captures the real tradeoff better than vague "Bun is fast" claims.

I checked the migration and frozen-install behavior with Bun 1.3.14. It converted a small npm fixture from `package-lock.json` to `bun.lock`, and `bun ci` failed when I changed `package.json` without updating the lockfile. That is the behavior I want from CI.

## When Bun is worth switching to

Bun is a good fit when at least one of these is true:

- you want to replace both your package manager and runtime together
- you want one command style across install, scripts, tests, and builds
- you are starting a fresh project and do not need maximum historical compatibility
- your team wants stricter dependency-script behavior by default

Bun is a weaker fit when your main goal is only "make installs better" while keeping everything else exactly the same. In that case, pnpm is usually the more conservative choice.

## Bun vs pnpm

This is usually the comparison that matters most.

### Choose Bun over pnpm when:

- you want Bun's runtime as part of the switch
- you like Bun's text lockfile and integrated tooling story
- you want a package manager that can also run your scripts without adding another layer

### Choose pnpm over Bun when:

- you want the smallest possible change from a standard Node.js stack
- you care most about package-manager behavior, not runtime consolidation
- you have a mature monorepo and prefer the most established workspace story

Bun's isolated installs are explicitly positioned as similar to pnpm's stricter dependency model, which is useful if you want pnpm-like discipline without adopting pnpm itself.

## Bun vs npm

This comparison is simpler.

### Choose Bun over npm when:

- you want a more modern toolchain default
- you are open to adopting a different runtime
- you want workspace filtering and Bun-native tooling in one place

### Keep npm when:

- maximum compatibility matters more than tool consolidation
- the project already works well and the switch would create churn without meaningful payoff
- your team is not trying to change runtimes right now

In other words, Bun is not an "npm but a bit nicer" choice. It is a broader stack decision.

## The Bun package-manager features that matter most

The current Bun docs make these details worth paying attention to:

- Bun now uses the text-based `bun.lock` lockfile
- `bun install --save-text-lockfile` helps migrate older binary lockfiles
- `bun install --frozen-lockfile` is the no-surprises install mode for CI-style workflows
- `bun install --filter` targets specific workspace packages
- Bun supports isolated installs with `--linker isolated`
- arbitrary dependency scripts are blocked unless the package is in Bun's default trusted list or your own `trustedDependencies`

Those are meaningful differences, not cosmetic ones.

## A practical migration path

If you are testing Bun in an existing npm, Yarn, or pnpm project, keep the migration boring:

```bash
bun install
```

Bun can migrate these lockfiles automatically when `bun.lock` does not exist:

- `package-lock.json`
- `yarn.lock`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`

It preserves the original lockfile. Keep it until you have reviewed `bun.lock` and run the project's real tests and build.

Then use the frozen install in automation:

```bash
bun ci
bun run test
bun run build
```

`bun ci` is equivalent to `bun install --frozen-lockfile`. It fails instead of rewriting `bun.lock` when `package.json` disagrees with it.

If you are moving from the older binary lockfile format, convert it like this:

```bash
bun install --save-text-lockfile --frozen-lockfile --lockfile-only
```

Verify the new `bun.lock`, then delete `bun.lockb`. The longer command is intentional: it converts the existing resolution without installing packages or changing versions.

## Use Bun in GitHub Actions

Install a known Bun release, enforce the lockfile, then run the same project checks you use locally:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
    with:
      bun-version: 1.3.14

  - run: bun ci
  - run: bun run test
  - run: bun run build
```

Pinning the version keeps a Bun runtime update from silently joining an unrelated application change. Update it deliberately after the same checks pass.

## Monorepos and workspace filtering

Bun has become much more credible for monorepo workflows than the early versions many people still remember.

Useful commands include:

```bash
bun install --filter apps/web --filter packages/ui
```

And if you want stricter dependency boundaries:

```bash
bun install --linker isolated
```

That is the part of Bun that overlaps most with pnpm's appeal.

## Security and dependency scripts

One reason some teams like Bun is that arbitrary dependency scripts do not all run automatically.

The precise rule matters: Bun maintains a default trusted list for popular packages, and you can explicitly allow more packages with `trustedDependencies` in `package.json`.

```json
{
    "trustedDependencies": ["sharp"]
}
```

Run `bun pm untrusted` to see dependencies whose lifecycle scripts were blocked. Trust a package because the project needs and expects its install script, not merely because an error disappeared.

That makes Bun's default posture more appealing for cautious teams than the classic "install first, hope the lifecycle scripts are fine" flow.

## So, when should you actually switch?

Here is the decision framework I would use.

### Switch to Bun now if:

- you want Bun as both runtime and package manager
- you are starting a new app or modernizing a simpler project
- you want one tool to cover install, run, and test workflows

### Prefer pnpm if:

- your project already runs on Node.js and you want the least disruptive improvement
- the main pain is package management, not runtime choice
- you have a large monorepo and want the most mature package-manager-first path

### Stay on npm if:

- your team values stability over experimentation
- the current setup is not the bottleneck
- third-party tooling compatibility is the main priority

Bun is worth switching to when you want a broader tooling change, not just a faster install command. If you mostly want a better package manager while keeping the rest of your Node.js setup familiar, pnpm is usually the sharper comparison and often the safer answer.

If you are comparing Bun against the rest of your JavaScript workflow, these are the next reads I would keep open:

- [Swap npm out for Bun in Laravel without friction](/bun-laravel)
- [Use Bun in plain PHP projects too, not just Laravel](/bun-php)
- [Use `npm ci` when you need repeatable installs, not surprises](/npm-ci)
- [Hide the npm funding message when you just want clean installs](/npm-fund)
