# The code behind a blog that generated $20K+ and peaked at 100K monthly visits

This is the source code for [benjamincrozat.com](https://benjamincrozat.com), my content-driven developer blog and one of the main ways I market my work.

It has generated more than **$20,000 in revenue** (in 3.5 years, don't get excited!) and reached a peak of **100,000 visits per month**.

If you're checking me out as a developer, this repo shows how I build and run a real Laravel publishing business: content, monetization, automation, performance, and editorial tooling included.

**Feel free to borrow whatever is useful.** If you want to keep up with what I ship, follow me on [X](https://x.com/benjamincrozat).

## What you'll find inside

- **A real-world Laravel application:**  
  Clean, production-tested code with Actions, Jobs, Policies, queues, scheduled tasks, and the kind of decisions that come from running a site people actually use.

- **A content engine, not a demo project:**  
  Posts are managed in Markdown, synced into the app, enriched with images, and published through a workflow designed for consistent output.

- **Monetization and analytics patterns:**  
  Affiliate links, attribution, ad-blocker-resistant analytics, and the practical plumbing behind a site that earns revenue.

- **Automation and background processing:**  
  Queues, Horizon, and scheduled jobs that keep repetitive work off the critical path.

- **Cloudflare Images integration:**  
  A pragmatic image workflow for hero images and inline article assets without building a custom media system from scratch.

- **A serious testing mindset:**  
  A large Pest test suite that helps keep the publishing flow and business logic reliable as the site evolves.
